This is a CustomTKinter Python application that simply acts as a basic module to communicate with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

There are several pre-selected questions that you can ask using the buttons along the left-hand side. 

In order for this to function on your computer, you would need to have a 'config.py' file in the application's main directory, containing
a unique OpenAI API Key. These are freely accessible from their website after creating an Account at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

After acquiring the key, create a text file in the 'OverlandChatApp' folder, containing the following:

myKey = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Save it as 'config.py'. You should then be able to launch the executable from the 'Dist' folder.
